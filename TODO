- askBehavior: once an answer is given to a question, go to another question
- askBehavior: once an answer is given to a question, ask a detail about answer
- find a way to make the bot response logic less fragile (those hard coded array indexes...)


+ when bot is given a one word response, use question as key, and collect multiple NN|UNKNOWN
+ collect multiple values after PRP,.*,VBZ
+ when bot is given a one word response, use question as key

+ PRP, * (anything not a verb) VBZ ... my * is
+ switch hard-coded input pattern rules to regexps 
+ according to assignment, bot needs to ask first question...
