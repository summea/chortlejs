TODO
====
- crunch found pattern matches together?
- askBehavior: once an answer is given to a question, go to another question
- askBehavior: once an answer is given to a question, ask a detail about answer
- find a way to make the bot response logic less fragile (those hard coded array indexes...)
- questions have a piece of info we want (a target) ex: what is your name? (_name_ is target)
- keep track of what question number we are on
- check expected pattern from user


+ add expected response pattern functionality (in questions array)
+ when bot is given a one word response, use question as key, and collect multiple NN|UNKNOWN
+ collect multiple values after PRP,.*,VBZ
+ when bot is given a one word response, use question as key
+ PRP, * (anything not a verb) VBZ ... my * is
+ switch hard-coded input pattern rules to regexps 
+ according to assignment, bot needs to ask first question...
+ look for pattern match (e.g. PRP + VBP + NN)
